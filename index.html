    <ul class="oswald">
      <li><strong>June 11, 1910</strong> - Born in Saint-André-de-Cubzac, Gironde, France</li>
      
      <li><strong>1930</strong> - Entered the military but suffered an accident, changing his plans to become a pilot, so he shifted to his love of the ocean</li>
      
      <li><strong>1940's</strong> - After the armistice of 1940, the family of Simone and Jacques-Yves Cousteau took refuge in Megève, where he became a friend of the Ichac family who also lived there. Jacques-Yves Cousteau and Marcel Ichac shared the same desire to reveal to the general public unknown and inaccessible places — for Cousteau the underwater world and for Ichac the high mountains.</li>
      
      <li><strong>1943</strong> - They made the film Épaves (Shipwrecks), in which they used two of the very first Aqua-Lung prototypes</li>
      
      <li><strong>1946</strong> - Cousteau and Tailliez showed the film Épaves ("Shipwrecks") to Admiral Lemonnier, who gave them the responsibility of setting up the Groupement de Recherches Sous-marines (GRS) (Underwater Research Group) of the French Navy in Toulon.</li>
      
      <li><strong>1948</strong> - between missions of mine clearance, underwater exploration and technological and physiological tests, Cousteau undertook a first campaign in the Mediterranean on board the sloop Élie Monnier, with Philippe Tailliez, Frédéric Dumas, Jean Alinat and the scenario writer Marcel Ichac. </li>
      
      <li><strong>1949</strong> - Cousteau left the French Navy.</li>
      
      <li><strong>1953</strong> - Published "The Silent World" where he correctly predicted the existence of the echolocation abilities of porpoises. </li>
      
      <li><strong>1954</strong> - Conducted a survey of Abu Dhabi waters on behalf of British Petroleum.</li>
      <strong>1956</strong> - Among those accompanying him was Louis Malle who made a black-and-white film of the expedition for the company. Cousteau won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival for The Silent World co-produced with Malle</li>
    
      <li><strong>1957</strong> - elected as director of the Oceanographical Museum of Monaco</li>

      <li><strong>1973</strong> - Along with his two sons and Frederick Hyman, he created the Cousteau Society for the Protection of Ocean Life, Frederick Hyman being its first President.</li>
    
      <li><strong>June 18, 1979</strong> - While the Calypso was on an expedition to Portugal, his second son Philippe, his preferred and designated successor and with whom he had co-produced all his films since 1969, died in a PBY Catalina flying boat crash in the Tagus river near Lisbon. Cousteau was deeply affected. He called his then eldest son, the architect Jean-Michel, to his side. This collaboration lasted 14 years.</li>
